-- Case 1: Empty list of list tuples
-- Case 2: At least one element in list1 and empty list2 ->
--  attach x as head of first list and '-' as head of second list. The lists
--  being returned from recursive call of optAlignments on remaining list contents.
-- Case 3: Same as 2 except first is empty and second is not.
-- Case 4: Both lists have contents -> Create all alignments by concatenating
--  the result of attaching both heads to respective list, attaching x as head for first and '-' as head for second
--  and vice versa. Then perform maximaBy on these three different results to get the
--  best one.
